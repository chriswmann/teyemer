# Teyemer

Teymer provides timed beeps to remind you to look away from your screen.

It is a simple tool that can help you reduce eye strain and prevent computer vision syndrome.

The default settings are to beep every 20 minutes, first at A5 (880 Hz) and then at E6 (1318.51 Hz),
but you can customize the interval and the  duration of the beep via command line arguments.
